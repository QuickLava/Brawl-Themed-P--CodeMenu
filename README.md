# PowerPC Assembly Functions (Code Menu Building Utility)
A continuation of Fracture17 and DesiacX's Code Menu Builder for use in both Project+ Ex and Project+ based builds! In particular, this continuation focuses on providing a simple means of configuring different aspects of the menu without needing to manually edit and recompile the builder's source code at all, while additionally offering a slew of brand new features, bug fixes, and under-the-hood improvements and optimizations.
